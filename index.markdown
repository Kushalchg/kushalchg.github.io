This is kushal's actual home on internet. Believe me I know  javascript, react
and can design and build better site than this, but using react for portfolio ...oh that's too much maintenance.

I know you are special (you visited this site), since you already here you can checkout my other works. 

-   [Openpte.com](https://openpte.com) - **(Actively Building)** *PTE(Pearson Test of English) preparation platform with the AI. User can practice with AI and get instant feedback with congertational AI where users can chat about the question and their submissions with the AI(llms).*

-   [VibeNepse](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kushalchapagain.ScriptAf&pcampaignid=web_share) - *Offline Nepse portfolio tracker app,
    where users can track without login and of course you will get real-time data
    when online but only your script's symbol will be used for that.*

-   [react-native-nepali-picker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-nepali-picker) - *A simple, customizable and modern Nepali date picker for React Native applications.*


If you feel this is too basic website, checkout [kushalchapagain.com.np](https://kushalchapagain.com.np) which is also simple but build with (next.js and tailwindcss).
